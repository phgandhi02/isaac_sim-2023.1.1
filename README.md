# Modded Isaac Sim
I had crafted a .gitignore that only keeps the relevant parts of the Isaac Sim and Omniverse extensions. It only keeps the .py, .md, .toml files which contain any necessary code, documentation, or config necessary for the Omniverse/Isaac Sim dev to deal with. Everything else should not need to be modified.
