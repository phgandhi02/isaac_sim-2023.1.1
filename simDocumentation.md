Isaac sim (isaac) is a popular robotics simualtion tool. Isaac is a wrapper ontop of Omniverse (omni). There are two ways to develop in this workflow. One way is to use the Isaac Sim API which are an abstraction of the Omniverse API or to use the Omniverse API directly with PhysX API (physx).

Scene construction can be done using either isaac API or the omni API with physx API. Isaac seems to implement more of the robotics terminology and operates at a higher level but is also slower because it is an abstraction that is not well-optimized. Omniverse with PhysX is more performant though both are very compute heavy.
